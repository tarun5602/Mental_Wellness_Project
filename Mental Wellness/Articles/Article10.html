        <p class="head1">Bipolar Disorder I</p>
        <p class="content">
            Bipolar I disorder requires symptoms to meet the full criteria for what is known as a manic episode. You do
            not have to experience depression to be diagnosed with Bipolar I, but many people with the diagnosis
            experience both kinds of mood episodes.
            <br><br>
            A manic episode must include at least three of the following symptoms:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>increased talkativeness</li>
            <li>increased self-esteem or grandiosity</li>
            <li>decreased need for sleep</li>
            <li>increase in goal-direct activity, energy level, or irritability</li>
            <li>racing thoughts</li>
            <li>poor attention</li>
            <li>increased risk-taking (spending money, risky sexual behaviors, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Mania is much more extreme than a sudden burst in energy or motivation or a happy mood. It often results in
            problems in work, school, and relationships, and it some cases it may require hospitalization. A manic
            episode is also just as frequently characterized by an irritable mood as an elevated one for people with
            Bipolar I, so never assume a manic episode is not present because a person doesn’t not appear happy or
            enthusiastic.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">Bipolar Disorder II</p>
        <p class="content">
            To qualify for a diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder, a person has to have experienced a depressive episode and
            a less severe form of mania which is known as hypomania. A person experiencing mania will exhibit manic
            symptoms but is able to continue with day-to-day responsibilities and may even see an increase in job
            performance or other goal-directed activity. The elevated mood, however, is not so severe that the person
            requires hospitalization or experiences significant disruption at home or work.
            <br><br>
            To meet the criteria for a depressive episode, a person must experience 5 or more of the following symptoms:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>depressed mood</li>
            <li>changes in sleep</li>
            <li>changes in eating</li>
            <li>fatigue or lack of energy</li>
            <li>loss of pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
            <li>restlessness or slowing down</li>
            <li>feelings of guilt or worthlessness</li>
            <li>indecision or difficulty concentrating</li>
            <li>thoughts of suicide</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Many people with Bipolar II Disorder are diagnosed with depression because they fail to report the elevated
            mood symptoms of hypomania to their doctor. People with Bipolar II also may be at higher risk for substance
            use and eating disorders. They are also more likely to have a relative in their immediate family with a
            psychiatric illness. 4 To summarize, a Bipolar I diagnosis requires a manic episode but also can include
            depression. A Bipolar II diagnosis requires both a depressive episode and a hypomanic episode.
            <br><br>
            Your Bipolar diagnosis can affect the course of treatment and medication recommended by your doctor, so it’s
            important to report all mood symptoms to your doctor. Treating depression and not mania could increase risk
            of mania episode or of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, so it’s imperative to keep track of both highs and
            lows.6 Because drugs and alcohol can trigger episodes of mania or depression, you may have to complete
            detoxification from substances before you are given a diagnosis.
            <br><br>
            Keeping track of your mood, energy level, attention span, and behaviors every day can help you receive the
            most accurate diagnosis. Staying informed and staying patient with the diagnostic process also gives you the
            best chance for managing symptoms and reducing the frequency and intensity of mood changes. With the right
            team of support and the right tools for keeping track of your symptoms, it is possible to manage mental
            illness and live a full and goal-directed life. What steps can you take today to plug into the best
            resources for your mind and body?
