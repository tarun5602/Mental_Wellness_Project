        <p class="content"> Major depression on its own is debilitating
            and scary. But in some individuals, it occurs
            along with psychosis,a transient mental state characterized
            by abnormal perceptions that may include delusions and
            hallucinations.When psychosis accompanies major depression,
            it’s called psychotic depression or depression with psychosis.
            It’s estimated that anywhere from 14 to nearly 50% of people
            diagnosed with depression have psychotic depression,
            and geriatric patients are especially prone to it. <br>

           <br> Psychotic depression is taken very seriously by mental health
            professionals because the individual suffering
            from it is at an increased risk of self-harm. <br>

           <br> “The suicide rate in people with psychotic depression, when they are ill and in
            their acute phase, is much
            higher than it is with major depression,” says Anthony J. Rothschild, MD, the Irving S
            . and Betty Brudnick
            Endowed Chair, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester,
            Massachusetts and the author of the Clinical Manual for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Psychotic Depression. <br>
            <br><br>

            It’s important to distinguish psychotic depression from psychosis as well as schizophrenia,
             experts say.
            Psychosis by itself is not a disease, explains Timothy B. Sullivan, MD, chair of Psychiatry
             and Behavioral
            Sciences at Staten Island University Hospital in Staten Island, New York. “It’s not an illness in itself,
            just as fever is not an illness,” he explains. “Psychosis is caused by an impairment in the part of the
            brain that helps us discern what is happening internally versus what is happening externally.” <br>
       
           <br> Psychosis is common, says Theresa Nguyen, LSCW, of Mental Health America (MHA).
              “Some 3% of the population experiences it at some point,” she says. “Some 
               changes makes a person see or hear things that are not there. And the longer
                the person experiences psychosis without getting treatment, the more she starts
                 to become more convinced that the things she sees, hears, and believes are real.” <br><br>

                 “While psychosis can look like schizophrenia, an individual with schizophrenia will
                 have delusions and hallucinations regardless of whether they are depressed,” says Ms. Nguyen.

            Symptoms
        </p>
        <p class="content" >
           <br>  To be called a psychotic depression, according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic
             and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, major depression must be present along with
              delusions and/or hallucinations. If psychotic features are present, they must be either
               mood-congruent (having to do with typical depressive themes like personal inadequacy,
                death, or deserved punishment) or non mood-congruent (in other words, not involving the
                 depressive themes). Typically, the psychotic symptoms have a depressive “theme,” such
                  as delusions of guilt, poverty, or illness.2 <br><br>

                  Typically, the person with psychotic depression exhibits a low, sad mood,
                   with poor concentration and feelings of lack of self-worth and guilt, says
                    Anil Malhotra, MD, vice chair of research in the department of psychiatry
                     at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell in Hempstead, New York.
                      “And there are the psychotic features,” he says. “The person hears or sees
                       voices and things that are not real, which are hallucinations, and believes
                        things that are not real, which are delusions.” <br><br>

                        What’s important to keep in mind is that hallucinations are much less common
                         than delusions in a person with psychotic depression, says Dr. Rothschild.
                          “The delusions are very common and are of a depressing, nihilistic nature,”
                           he explains. “For instance, the person may say they are dying of cancer,
                            or that they lost all their money, or that they did something bad, like 
                            not pay their taxes. The interesting thing is that on the surface, these
                             delusions could be true. They have an air of reality about them.” <br><br>

                             One of the reasons that psychotic depression is not easily diagnosed,
                              he says, is that people with psychotic depression often realize that
                               their thoughts may not be “quite right” so they keep them to themselves.
                                Dr. Rothschild described one patient who was convinced that he was going
                                 to die of prostate cancer. Multiple doctors had examined him and found his
                                  prostate to be healthy, but he refused to accept this news. Finally, it was
                                   suggested that he have a consultation with Dr. Rothschild, who diagnosed him
                                    with psychotic depression. After treatment, the patient got better. <br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="head1" >
            Risk Factors
        </p>
        <p class="content" >
            One of the biggest risk factors is childhood trauma, says
             Dr. Rothschild. “Early life trauma puts you at risk,” he says.
              “The loss of a parent before age 11, for instance, or any trauma
               such as sexual or physical abuse puts you at risk. And if a person
                with these risk factors gets depressed as an adult, they are at a 
                higher risk for psychotic depression.” <br><br>

                Additionally, it’s more likely for people to develop psychotic
                 depression as they get older. “Psychotic depression can occur
                  in any age group but it is not uncommon for someone with no prior
                   psychiatric history to present with psychotic depression in their
                    60s, 70s, or 80s,” Dr. Rothschild says. “In older people, delusions
                     of poverty or somatic delusions, for example, believing one is suffering
                      from a fatal illness, are more likely to be present.” <br><br>

        </p>
        <p class="head1" >How Psychotic Depression Differs from Schizophrenia</p>
        <p class="content" >
            “If the person has pure psychosis, without much depression, it is more 
            likely to be schizophrenia,” says Amit Anand, MD, professor and Vice Chair
             for Research at the Center for Behavioral Health at the Cleveland Clinic.
              “And with schizophrenia, the depression is usually not predominant and 
              the person has hallucinations and delusions that don’t go away. They
               also have decreased thinking, feelings and motivation.” <br><br>

               Schizophrenia tends to make an appearance for the first
                time when the patient is in their late teens or early
                 20s while individuals can have psychotic depression at 
                 any age, Dr. Rothschild says. “Schizophrenia is more long-lasting
                  and is not episodic,” he explains. “The delusions tend to be more
                   bizarre, although we don’t make the diagnosis based on the type
                    of delusion.” <br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="head1" >Treatment for Psychotic Depression</p>
        <p class="content" >
            There are two modalities of treatment for psychotic depression,
             Dr. Rothschild says. “The combination of an antidepressant with
              an antipsychotic is one, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is
               the other,” he says. “That is a decision to make with the family
               and it depends on the situation.” <br><br>

               In some older patients, ECT may be used in order
                to avoid the side effects of medication. Sometimes
                 a course of ECT is prescribed and then the antidepressant
                  and antipsychotic are taken afterward. Talk therapy can
                   be helpful, too, he says, but only after the first line
                    treatment of medication or ECT has been started, Dr. Rothschild says. <br><br>

                    The prognosis for recovering from psychotic depression is excellent,
                     Dr. Rothschild says. “As you can imagine, if you have an episode of
                      psychotic depression it can cause a lot of disruption in your life,” 
                      he says. “It depends on the person but generally speaking, a person
                       who receives treatment for psychotic depression can be back to their
                        normal self in a couple of months.” <br><br>
