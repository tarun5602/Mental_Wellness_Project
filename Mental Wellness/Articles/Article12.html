        <h1>Social Media and Teens: How Does Social Media Affect Teenagers’ Mental Health</h1>
        <p class="content">
            The verdict is still out on whether social media is damaging to the mental health of teens. This is in part
            due to the lack of research. Some studies show that online connections with small groups of people can be
            beneficial to teens, while other research points to a rise in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and eating
            disorders.
            <br><br>
            The other reason it’s difficult to get a good read on the issue is that social media is constantly changing
            and evolving. Plus, no long-term studies have been completed. So, we’re left making educated guesses based
            on current research. There’s just not enough data to back up the potential long-term pros and cons of living
            on “likes”.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">The Upside of Social Media for Teens</p>
        <p class="content">
            There are some positive aspects to social media. It’s important to remember that teens are hardwired for
            socialization, and social media makes socializing easy and immediate. Teens who struggle with social skills,
            social anxiety, or who don’t have easy access to face-to-face socializing with other teens might benefit
            from connecting with other teens through social media.
            <br><br>
            Teens in marginalized groups—including LGBTQ teens and teens struggling with mental health issues—can find
            support and friendship through use of social media. When teens connect with small groups of supportive teens
            via social media, those connections can be the difference between living in isolation and finding support.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">The Downside Social Media Use by Teens</p>
        <p class="content">
            Read enough of the current research and you’ll find that the negatives tend to feel bigger than the
            positives. While teens can use social media to connect and create friendships with others, they also
            confront cyberbullying, trolls, toxic comparisons, sleep deprivation, and less frequent face-to-face
            interactions, to name a few.
            <br><br>
            Too much time spent scrolling through social media can result in symptoms of anxiety and/or depression.
            Here’s how social media can be destructive:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li><b>Focusing on likes:</b> The need to gain “likes” on social media can cause teens to make choices they
                would otherwise not make, including altering their appearance, engaging in negative behaviors, and
                accepting risky social media challenges.</li><br>
            <li><b>Cyberbullying:</b>Teens girls in particular are at risk of cyberbullying through use of social media,
                but teen boys are not immune. Cyberbullying is associated with depression, anxiety, and an elevated risk
                of suicidal thoughts.</li><br>
            <li><b>Making comparisons: </b>Though many teens know that their peers share only their highlight reels on
                social media, it’s very difficult to avoid making comparisons. Everything from physical appearance to
                life circumstances to perceived successes and failures are under a microscope on social media.</li><br>
            <li><b>Having too many fake friends:</b> Even with privacy settings in place, teens can collect thousands of
                friends through friends of friends on social media. The more people on the friend list, the more people
                have access to screenshot photos, Snaps, and updates and use them for other purposes. There is no
                privacy on social media.</li><br>
            <li><b>Less face time:</b> Social interaction skills require daily practice, even for teens. It’s difficult
                to build empathy and compassion (our best weapons in the war on bullying) when teens spend more time
                “engaging” online than they do in person. Human connection is a powerful tool and builds skills that
                last a lifetime.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            There’s a happy medium in here somewhere. The key to helping teens learn to balance social media with real
            life friendships is to keep the lines of communication open and keep talking. Honest communication shows
            your teen that you are there to support, not to judge or lecture. It’s also important to walk the walk.
            Disconnect on weekends and show your teen that there is a whole world out there that doesn’t require a
            handheld screen. She may miss her phone a lot less than she thinks she will and this is a very good lesson
            to learn.
