        <p class="head1">Thoughts about depression, posted online, explain what it's like and a therapist adds her take.
            If you are depressed, share this with your loved ones to help them understand.</p>
        <h1>What is depression like? It's like drowning, except everyone around you is breathing.</h1>
        <p class="content">
            I love this quote. It perfectly describes how absolutely alone and terrifying it is to be imprisoned inside
            the inescapable bog that comprises serious depression. You feel utterly helpless, leaden, dull, unable to
            move. You are trapped an unwilling witness to those living what appear to be happy lives. Anger at
            everyone's obliviousness to your condition invades your lungs, heart, and spirit.
            <br><br>
            The waves of pincer-like pain keep pummeling your brain as your body is dragged down, down, down onto the
            inky, cold depths of the ocean floor, choking you. The question: Stay fetal-like or fight your way to the
            surface?
        </p>
        <h1>When you're depressed you don't control your thoughts, your thoughts control you. I wish people understood
            that.</h1>
        <p class="content">
            This quote is painfully true. According to the World Health Organization, depression can make a person feel
            his or her mind has taken control of the show, with self-attacking thoughts tumbling after another with
            volcanic force: I'm so stupid; Everyone is looking at me and laughing; Nothing good ever happens for me…To
            someone beset with this chronic mental battering, the negative thought train, no matter how outlandish,
            seems entirely credible.
        </p>
        <h1>Depression is feeling like you've lost something but having no clue when or where you last had it. Then one
            day you realize what you lost is yourself.</h1>
        <p class="content">
            I don't recognize myself anymore is a common refrain of someone suffering from clinical depression.
            <br><br>
            People will call your name, recognizing someone they think they know. But looking back at you from the
            mirror is a stranger with a haunted, hopeless expression. You remember once experiencing anticipation and
            joy but it feels like those emotions occurred in a far-off, never-to-be revisited galaxy. You recall happy
            memories like scenes from a movie once viewed, not as something personally experienced. I know I used to
            laugh and joke but now all I want to do is sleep, more than one patient in the throes of depression has told
            me.
        </p>
        <h1>My lips say, Fine, thanks, but my eyes tell a different story, my heart sings a different tune, and my
            soul just weeps.</h1>
        <p class="content">
            Someone in the midst of a deep depressive episode feels like he or she is walking around in a
            shroud—suffering the torment of being physically alive while emotionally lifeless.
            <br><br>
            When you force yourself to eat (likely chided to by worried loved ones), food is tasteless. Rather than
            lighting your soul, the sun's rays feel like pellets against your skin. Whether your eyes are open or
            closed, existentially all you see is full-eclipse blackness. Watching a comedy that's always made you
            guffaw, all you can summon is a plastic smile. You sleepwalk through your days, craving the 'little death'
            of sleep to escape the torture of being awake.
        </p>
        <h1>People think depression is sadness. People think depression is crying. People think depression is dressing
            in black. But people are wrong. Depression is the constant feeling of being numb. Being numb to emotions,
            being numb to life. You wake up in the morning just to go to bed again.</h1>
        <p class="content">
            Sadness is a common feeling in the kaleidoscope of diverse human emotions. It can be triggered by a terrible
            experience such as going through a romantic breakup or listening to survivors of a mass shooting talking on
            television. You will cry, perhaps turn down social engagements, feel darkness but in time the kaleidoscope
            will shift to a cheerier hue.
        </p>
        <h1>That's the thing about depression: A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end
            in sight. But depression is so insidious—and it compounds daily—making it impossible to ever see the end.
            That fog is like a cage without a key.</h1>
        <p class="content">
            This famous quote was taken from the best-selling memoir by Elizabeth Wurtzel, Prozac Nation: Young and
            Depressed in America (1994). It perfectly describes the utter hopelessness of enduring what feels like
            endless blackness. Human beings need hope to lift themselves up. If your thoughts tell you there is no
            possibility of ever feeling better, the chances of recovering are dimmed. Then there is little motivation or
            ability to work in therapy or partake in any pleasurable activities. Expecting the worst helps create a
            self-fulfilling prophecy.
        </p>
        <h1>When you suffer from depression, 'I'm tired' means a permanent state of exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix.
            Sleep just isn't sleep anymore it's escape.</h1>
        <p class="content">
            There are few things more energizing than waking up from a good night's sleep feeling refreshed and ready to
            tackle the day. Alas, no matter how many hours someone with the overwhelming emotional fatigue that comes
            with clinical depression sleeps he or she awakes to that stomach-drop feeling of Oh no, I've got to get
            through another full day before I can go to back to bed. No matter what age you are, emotionally you feel as
            if you are 100-years-old. You drag yourself with leaden feet through daily chores, counting down the hours
            until you can lie down and shut out the world again.
        </p>
        <h1>The only thing more exhausting than being depressed is pretending that you're not.</h1>
        <p class="content">
            Actors choose to play a role; severely depressed people feel they have no choice but to put on an Academy
            Award-worthy performance of someone who is enjoying his or her time on the planet. However, there are huge
            emotional costs to hiding your truth such as an increase in the sense of disconnect from others in your
            life. When there is no one with whom you can be 'real', there is no break from your misery and solitude.
            Thus the sense of exhaustion that is wrapped into depression grows exponentially. Each time you lie and say
            you are fine, you die a little more inside.
        </p>
        <h1>They ask, How are you doing? But what they mean is, Are you over it yet?</h1>
        <p class="content">
            Those who suffer from depression know more than anyone that they are not—well—fun to be around. It is a drag
            to be at dinner with someone literally crying into his or her soup. Others empathize with your pain…to a
            point. But unless they've spent time at the bottom of the emotional barrel, they can't really get what it
            feels like. They mean well saying something along the lines of, I've been sad, dear, and what got me back to
            myself was a yoga weekend and thinking positive. Gave a fresh perspective! Such a tone-deaf comment can at
            least for a moment lift the depressed person to a new level—ANGER!
