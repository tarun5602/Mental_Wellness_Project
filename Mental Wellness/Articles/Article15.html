        <h1>Learn about PTSD symptoms, causes, and treatment options available</h1>
        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p class="content">
            If you live through a terrifying event or experience, such as a horrific car crash, a killer tornado that
            cripples your hometown, or domestic violence, you are likely to feel shattered and experience difficulty
            coping and adjusting. However, as time goes on, and with good individual care, you are likely to get better
            and move on with your life. On the other hand, if you can’t stop reliving the experiences and it affects
            your everyday functioning, you might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If you are
            suffering from this debilitating condition, you are not alone, but great treatment options are available.
            <br><br>
            One of the few mental illnesses triggered by an outside, traumatizing event, you can suffer from PTSD by
            experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. What is considered traumatic? Certain traumatic events can be
            so severely frightening and overwhelming to individuals that they can cause temporary and sometimes
            permanent changes to how we physically and psychologically respond to stress in our lives. You may find
            yourself wondering what types of trauma can cause these changes to our physical and psychological responses.
            Any unexpected violation to our physical and mental well-being can be considered a trauma. Some of the most
            common traumatic events that may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder include:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Sudden death of a loved one</li>
            <li>War</li>
            <li>Rape</li>
            <li>Kidnapping</li>
            <li>Natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes)</li>
            <li>Terrorist attacks</li>
            <li>Car or plane crashes</li>
            <li>Assault</li>
            <li>Childhood neglect</li>
            <li>Sexual or physical abuse</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will suffer from PTSD. As mentioned above, it’s normal to
            have nightmares, be fearful, and find difficulty “forgetting” what happened. When you get stuck in a state
            of fear and shock and your symptoms don’t improve or get worse, post-traumatic stress disorder is likely
            settling in because your body is having problems restoring itself to equilibrium.
        </p>
        <h2>PTSD Symptoms</h2>
        <p class="content">
            There is no way of knowing who will develop post-traumatic stress disorder after a traumatizing event. As
            evidenced by past research, the majority of people who witness or live through a traumatic event will not
            suffer from PTSD. Most will likely have memories of the events, but their lives will not become negatively
            impacted by it in their daily interactions.
        </p>
        <h3>Avoidance Symptoms</h3>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Avoiding places, activities, or people that remind you of the traumatic event</li>
            <li>Avoiding talking about or thinking about the traumatic event</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Intrusive Memories</h3>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Flashbacks – reliving the event as if it were happening all over again</li>
            <li>Upsetting dreams/nightmares about the traumatic event</li>
            <li>Recurrent memories of the traumatic event – even when you are trying not to think about them – as if
                they won’t “leave your mind”</li>
            <li>Experiencing severe emotional distress or physical reactions to things that remind you of the traumatic
                event</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Changes in Emotional Reactions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Overwhelming guilt or shame</li>
            <li>Jumpiness – being easily startled or frightened – jumping out of your skin</li>
            <li>Sleep disturbances</li>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
            <li>Always in “defense” mode – on guard for danger</li>
            <li>Irritability</li>
            <li>Angry outburst</li>
            <li>Aggressive behavior</li>
            <li>Self-destructive behavior (e.g., reckless driving, substance abuse)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Negative Changes in Thinking and Mood</h3>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Feeling negatively about yourself and others</li>
            <li>Lack of interest in activities you once found enjoyment in</li>
            <li>Difficulty maintaining relationships with others</li>
            <li>Memory problems – not being able to remember parts of the traumatic event</li>
            <li>Feelings of hopelessness for the future (e.g., marriage, career, living a normal life span)</li>
            <li>Emotional numbness – feeling detached from others</li>
            <li>Inability to experience positive emotions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Causes, Risk Factors, and Diagnosis</h2>
        <p class="content">
            You are more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder if the traumatic event you endure is
            life-threatening or severely traumatic to your personal safety. Additionally, the more exposure to the event
            or prolonged exposure to a traumatic event is also more likely to increase your chances of developing PTSD.
            Other risk factors of post-traumatic stress disorder include:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Family history of PTSD and depression</li>
            <li>History of physical or sexual abuse</li>
            <li>High level of stress in your daily life</li>
            <li>Lack of coping skills</li>
            <li>Not getting help or support after the traumatic event</li>
            <li>History of depression, anxiety, or other mental illness</li>
            <li>History of substance abuse</li>
            <li>Careers that exposure you to traumatic experiences (e.g., military, police, first responders)</li>
            <li>Experiencing previous traumatic events, especially early in one’s life</li>
            <li>Extent that the traumatic event was uncontrollable, inescapable, or unexpected</li>
            <li>Type of traumatic event – intentional, human-afflicted harm (e.g., rape, sexual abuse) is more likely to
                result in PTSD than an act of God (e.g., hurricane, earthquake)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder can increase your chances for other mental illnesses, such as
            depression and anxiety, suicide, eating disorders, and issues with drugs and alcohol. Therefore, it is
            especially important to seek treatment if you are suffering from PTSD for your own well-being. You should
            seek treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder if you are experiencing any of these symptoms and are not
            able to function or cannot function effectively in your day-to-day life. Individual may be affected
            differently by the symptoms of PTSD. PTSD symptoms in women, men, and children may present themselves in a
            variety of situations depending upon the trauma they have experienced.
            <br><br>
            Diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder is completed by medical professionals. Your diagnosis will be
            based on psychological evaluations of your signs and symptoms. To be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress
            disorder, you must meet the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
            published by the American Psychological Association. In addition to experiencing or witnessing a traumatic
            event, you must experience one or more of the following after exposure to the traumatic event:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Reliving the traumatic event</li>
            <li>Upsetting dreams/nightmares about the traumatic event</li>
            <li>Experience of flashbacks</li>
            <li>Experience of emotional distress related to the traumatic event</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            In combination with these symptoms, you may also experience debilitating behaviors and emotions one month or
            more post-traumatic event to include things such as avoidance behaviors, memory loss, emotional numbness,
            self-destructive behavior, and difficulty sleeping.
            <br><br>
            Your doctor or mental health professional will then make a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and
            refer to you a number of treatment options.
        </p>
        <h2>Treatment Options for Sufferers of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Several types of treatment options are available if you are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
            The most often prescribed method of treatment is psychotherapy. Medications and other types of physical
            treatment options are also prescribed. Your doctor will formulate the best treatment course of action for
            you.
            <br><br>
            <b>Psychotherapy,</b> often referred to as “talk therapy” has been shown to elicit great responses from
            sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder. Cognitive therapy is focused on recognizing patterns of
            thinking that get you “stuck” in your emotional state. For example, this type of therapy might help you in
            recognizing cognitive patterns associated with negative perceptions of normal situations. Exposure therapy
            is often coupled with cognitive therapy if you have been diagnosed with PTSD. Exposure therapy focuses on
            safe exposure to what is causing you intense fear. This exposure enables you to cope with the stimulus
            effectively and rationally. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of therapy that
            combines exposure therapy with guided eye movements. These combination of events in EMDR help you in your
            cognitive processing of traumatic events and allow you to effectively change your reactions to these types
            of events.
            <br><br>
            <b>Medications</b> that have been found useful in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder include
            antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including
            Zoloft and Praxil, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as antidepressant treatments for
            PTSD.
            <br><br>
