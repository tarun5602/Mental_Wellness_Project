        <h1>What is GAD? Why do I have it? How do I cope?</h1>
        <h2>Some Background</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Have you ever worried about your health? Money? The well-being of your family? Who hasn’t, right? These are
            common issues we all deal with and worry about from time to time. However, if you find yourself in constant
            worry over anything and everything in your life, even when there should be no cause for concern, you might
            be suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder. People with this condition often recognize they are
            “over-worrying” about a lot of issues, but have no control over the worry and associated anxiety. It is
            constant and can interfere with your ability to relax or sleep well and can cause you to startle easily.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the Symptoms?</h2>
        <p class="content">
            If you are suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, you just can’t shake your concerns about anything
            and everything. And the severity of the condition may come and go. During mild episodes of your condition,
            you are more likely to be able to hold down a job and not have the disorder interfere too much with your
            social life. When your anxiety flares up, you might experience difficulty with everyday life situations and
            find the simplest tasks unbearable.
            <br><br>
            So how do you know if your anxiety is “normal” or “excessive?” It’s normal to be worried about an upcoming
            test or wondering how you are going to cope financially when you unexpectedly find out you need major
            repairs done to your house. If you are suffering from the type of excessive worry that accompanies
            Generalized Anxiety Disorder, you may see a report on the local news about a new health scare in a different
            country and stay awake at night worrying about you or your family being affected, even though risks are
            minimal at best. You will likely spend the next few days and weeks in a constant state of worry about the
            well-being of your family and experience anxiety that is debilitating, intrusive, excessive, and persistent.
            <br><br>
            Generalized Anxiety Disorder can present itself mentally and physically. If you think you are suffering from
            this condition, you might be experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Perpetual state of constant worry</li>
            <li>Avoidance of stressful situations</li>
            <li>Feeling tense</li>
            <li>Muscle tightness or body aches</li>
            <li>Inability to relax or enjoy quiet time</li>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things</li>
            <li>No tolerance for uncertainty – needing to know what is going to happen and how it is going to happen
            </li>
            <li>Constant feelings of dread or apprehension</li>
            <li>Feeling overwhelmed and avoiding things or situations because of it</li>
            <li>Intrusive thoughts of things that cause you to worry – even when you try to stop thinking about them
            </li>
            <li>Feeling like you can’t control your emotions and constant worry – nothing you do helps you to relax</li>
            <li>Not being able to sleep at all or to sleep well because you are in a constant state of worry</li>
            <li>Feeling jumpy, on edge, or restless</li>
            <li>Stomach upset – including nausea and diarrhea</li>
            <li>Fatiguing easily</li>
            <li>Heart palpitations – feeling like your heart is racing</li>
            <li>Trembles or shakes</li>
            <li>Sweating and dry mouth</li>
            <li>Having difficulty breathing and/or feeling like you are choking</li>
            <li>Feeling lightheaded or dizzy</li>
            <li>Cold chills or hot flashes</li>
            <li>Numbness or tingling sensations</li>
            <li>Feeling like you have a lump in your throat</li>
            <li>Persistent irritability</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            To be classified with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, you must be experiencing a constant state of worry about
            a variety of everyday situations for at least six months. In addition, you must be experiencing at least
            three of the following six symptoms:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Irritability</li>
            <li>Muscle tension</li>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
            <li>Sleep disturbances</li>
            <li>Easy fatigue</li>
            <li>Restlessness or feeling on edge</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How is it Diagnosed? What Causes it?</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Great questions. Unfortunately, there is usually no clear cut answer – and like many mental health disorders
            – it is likely caused by a combination of genetic, behavioral, and developmental factors. Anatomically
            speaking, Generalized Anxiety Disorder is most closely related to a disruption in the functional
            connectivity of the amygdala – the “emotional control center” of the brain – and how it processes feelings
            of fear and anxiety. Genetics also play a role in Generalized Anxiety Disorder. If you have a family member
            that also suffers from this disorder, your chances of suffering from it are increased, especially in the
            presence of a life stressor. Interestingly, long-term substance abuse also increases your chances of
            Generalized Anxiety Disorder, as the use of benzodiazepines can worsen your anxiety levels, as can excessive
            alcohol use. Tobacco use and caffeine are also both associated with increased levels of anxiety.
            <br><br>
            If you believe you are suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, your doctor will perform a variety of
            physical exams as well as mental health checks. You might first go to your doctor complaining of constant
            headaches and trouble sleeping. After he or she rules out any underlying medical conditions that are causing
            your physical symptoms, s/he may refer you to a mental health specialist for further diagnosis. Your mental
            health specialist will ask you a series of psychological questions to get a better understanding of your
            condition. To be clinically diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, your doctor and/or mental health
            provider will assess the length of time you have been suffering from excessive worry and anxiety, your
            difficulty in controlling your anxiety, how your anxiety interferes with your daily life, and if you are
            experiencing fatigue, restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, sleep problems, and difficulty
            concentrating.
        </p>
        <h2>What Treatment Options are Available?</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Like other anxiety disorders, medications and therapy are the most common treatment options if you are
            suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder.
            <br><br>
            <b>Psychotherapy </b> -often referred to as “talk” therapy is one treatment option. Cognitive behavioral
            therapy is a very common method of psychotherapy that has shown great results for people living with
            Generalized Anxiety Disorder. This form of therapy is geared toward helping you recognize and understand
            your thoughts and the pattern of any negative thoughts you may experience. Cognitive behavioral therapy
            focuses on teaching you coping skills or
            mechanisms you can use to help you return to normal functioning and ease your feelings of anxiety. It is
            normally a short-term therapy and people who undergo this type of psychotherapy have found great results.
            <br><br>
            <b>Medications</b> are also a common form of treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The most common
            types of medications prescribed to individuals living with this form of anxiety include anti-depressants,
            anti-anxiety drugs, and in some cases, sedatives. Antidepressants are used to treat depression but have been
            found effective in the treatment of anxiety as well. They commonly take a couple of weeks to start taking
            effect and may cause some mild side effects, including headache, nausea, or difficulty sleeping. Most of the
            side effects are mild and tend to subside within a few weeks. Anti-anxiety medication is also often
            prescribed to help individuals cope with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. These types of drugs are powerful in
            their treatment of this type of anxiety; one of the most commonly prescribed types is a drug called
            buspirone often under the brand name Buspar.
            <br><br>
            During acute attacks of anxiety, your doctor may prescribe a sedative to ease your anxiety symptoms –
            though these should be used as needed and on a short-term basis.
            <br><br>
            Some people find that medication alone can be helpful in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder,
            while others are more likely to benefit from psychotherapy. Some find that the combination of psychotherapy
            and medication is the best course of action. Engaging in certain behaviors may also ease your anxiety and
            promote a healthier lifestyle. These include:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Daily exercise</li>
            <li>Limiting or stopping the use of caffeine</li>
            <li>Eating a healthy, well-balanced diet</li>
            <li>Stress management techniques – such as yoga or meditation</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            To decrease the occurrence of your anxiety in general, don’t miss your medication or any counseling sessions
            – even if you don’t feel like talking or feel “fine” and make sure you attend your regularly scheduled
            doctor’s appointments.
