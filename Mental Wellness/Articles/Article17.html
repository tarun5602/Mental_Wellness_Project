        <h1>New Thoughts and Hope for Schizophrenia Sufferers Overview and Facts – What is Schizophrenia?</h1>
        <p class="content">
            Are you having trouble separating reality from fantasy? Do you hear voices? Do you believe someone is reading your
            mind and controlling your thoughts? Are your thoughts “off” and are you having difficulty expressing how you feel, 
            act, and think? If so, you may be suffering from schizophrenia, a debilitating brain and behavioral disorder with 
            chronic and acute symptoms that occur continuously or intermittently throughout your lifespan.
        </p>
        <h2>Symptoms of Schizophrenia</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Signs and symptoms of schizophrenia are often categorized into positive and negative classifications and cognitive
            deficits. If you are suffering from schizophrenia and are undergoing treatment, you may have noticed that treatments
            tend to diminish positive symptoms pretty well. Negative symptoms are more prone to not respond to treatment as 
            readily as positive symptoms. Deficits in cognitive abilities are large indicators of the impact schizophrenia has 
            on the quality of life of an individual. If you are suffering from numerous cognitive deficits, your functioning as
            an adult with the illness will be minimized and successful treatment interventions will be harder to attain.

        <h2>Types of Schizophrenia</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3><li>Paranoid Schizophrenia:</li></h3>
            <p class="content">
                The most common type of schizophrenia characterized by psychosis misaligned with reality. If you are suffering 
                from paranoid schizophrenia, you may be unreasonably paranoid of others, have paranoid delusions that someone is 
                after you and that they are trying to hurt you. Common paranoid delusions include coworkers, spouses, the 
                government, and neighbors plotting to hurt you in some way. You may believe others are out to try to kill you, 
                spy on your, make your life miserable, poison you, or cheat on you. Paranoid schizophrenia has a severe impact on
                relationships, understandably so, as if you are suffering from this disorder, you believe those that are close to
                you are trying to hurt you in some way. This may cause you to feel angered and agitated. To cause an even deeper 
                impact on the situation, your paranoid delusions may be accompanied by hallucinations where you hear voices that 
                are insulting you or prompting you to do bad things.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Schizoaffective Disorder:</li></h3>
            <p class="content">
                Schizoaffective disorder is a type of combination disorder that combines symptoms of schizophrenia with a mood 
                disorder – most likely either major depression or bipolar disorder. This type of schizophrenia is chronic and 
                appears in intermittent episodes. Mood (affective) symptoms occur at the same time as the schizophrenic symptoms 
                and the schizophrenic symptoms often stay put after the mood symptoms disperse. Common symptoms of schizoaffective 
                disorder include depression, mania, and classic schizophrenia.
