            your brain and improve your mental health here</p>
        <p class="content">Your brain is an editor. One of its tasks is to choose how to narrate the story of what happens to you every day.
            It determines how every conversation and calamity fit in with your own life saga. How your brain interprets that fight
            with your partner or that failed job interview ultimately determines whether these events will cause negative emotions 
            and self-defeating thoughts. <br><br>
            When you feel anxious your editorial brain is tempted to cut corners for self-preservation. One such shortcut is the 
            “must” filter. Musts are beliefs that we have about how the world should work and how we should behave in it. They 
            are nice little boxes into which your brain tries to cram every event, but the reality is that these “musts” tend to 
            not be accurate or rational. They ignore the complexities of the human experience for black and white truths. Here 
            are a few common “musts” to watch out for when you start to worry. Stop telling yourself these five musts and see the 
            changes it can bring to your mental health.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <h1><li>I must be loved by everyone at all times.</li></h1>
            <p class="content">
                Many self-defeating thoughts and behaviors stem from the expectation of total and unconditional acceptance. 
                Though it is incredibly human to want to be accepted, loved, and praised, when you are constantly adjusting your 
                actions and reactions to achieve this desire, you start to lose your sense of self. You become a chameleon, quickly 
                changing to suit others’ perceptions. You can’t remember what’s important to you because your focus is on everyone else. 
                You equate self-worth with Facebook likes or pats on the back.
                <br><br>
                The reality is that you can never make everyone happy all the time. This “must” is as dangerous as it is irrational. 
                Instead, try focusing on your own values. What actions create self-respect? How can you be kind to others rather than
                simply seeking out their love? What recognition from your peers is practical, and what is just vanity?
            </p>
            <h1><li>I must be successful at everything.</li></h1>
            <p class="content">
                Setting yourself up for every behavior to be perfect can inspire fear and anxiety. You’re also more likely to 
                procrastinate when your expectations for yourself are impossible. Often the most successful people have failed 
                numerous times and embraced their flaws. Rather than being paralyzed by perfectionism, consider how your life 
                can be full in spite of and because of your limitations.
                <br><br>
                To fight this “must,” be careful not to make generalizations when you do fail. Not getting that job interview 
                does not imply you will never find employment. Getting stood up on a date does not mean you’ll be forever alone 
                with 70 cats. When your brain begins to shift into autopilot with words like “always” and “never,” then you 
                know you’re in irrational territory.
            </p>
            <h1><li>I must be upset by things I fear.</li></h1>
            <p class="content">
                Today’s world makes it easy to endlessly obsess over your worries, especially with 24-hour news networks and 
                social media. You get caught in the loop, assuming that the second you let your guard down or focus your mind 
                on something else, you’re putting yourself in danger. Obsessing, however, is not the same as examining. Often 
                when you examine the nature and reality of your fears, you’ll find that you can either face them or accept 
                their inevitability. Acceptance doesn’t mean surrender—it just means focusing on what you can control rather 
                than what you can’t. You can’t stop the inevitable heat death of the universe, but you can recycle your trash.
            </p>
            <h1><li>I must avoid all conflict.</li></h1>
            <p class="content">
                Cutting off or distancing yourself from people who are difficult can seem like the safest solution. Anxiety 
                goes down, and we can dodge those unpleasant and messy emotions. But this escape act is only a temporary fix. 
                You’ll experience more emotional reactivity and self-defeating dialogue within yourself when you always choose
                the quickest exit.
                <br><br>
                In life, we will all encounter people with whom we have conflict. There will be disagreements, and
                misunderstandings, and stress about communicating. Facing conflict head on by seeking to understand
                can seem impossible at first. But communication is a muscle that must be flexed to achieve a calmer and
                ultimately happier existence. The better you become at being thoughtful and articulate in times of uncertainty 
                and stress, the less that interpersonal drama will bother you in the long run.
            </p>
            <h1><li>I must have control over everything.</li></h1>
            <p class="content">
                Feeling a strong sense of control over what happens to you isn’t an unhealthy trait. In fact, people who have 
                more of an internal sense of control are likely to be more resilient during life’s challenges. However, when this 
                expectation extends to all events and situations, it becomes a dangerous “must.”
                <br><br>
                Much of what happens to you in life is because of sheer chance. We can’t make 100% accurate predictions, but that 
                doesn’t mean we should crawl back into bed and hide from the world. Instead, consider how you can still enjoy 
                life and be resilient despite the roll of the dice. You’ll recover more quickly from negative events, and you’ll 
                experience less self-blame and guilt.
                <br><br>
                Challenging your brain’s editorial process starts with a simple examination. Practice writing down your thoughts 
                and expectations about a situation, and consider which of these “musts” applies. Ironically, it’s the acceptance 
                of uncomfortable and uncontrollable moments that gives you more power over your emotions and reactions. When you 
                embrace the nuances of your humanness and the world around you, it’s amazing how much more fascinating life becomes.
