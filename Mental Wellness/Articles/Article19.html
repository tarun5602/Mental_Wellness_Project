        <p class="head1">What Is ADHD?</p>
        <p class="content">
            Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects both children and adults. 
            ADHD develops when the brain and central nervous system suffer impairments related to growth and development. A person with
            ADHD will show varying degrees of these three behaviors:  inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. 
        </p>
        <p class="head1">What causes ADHD?</p>
        <p class="content">
            It’s not clear what exactly causes ADHD, though there are factors that may increase the chances of developing the condition.
            While researchers haven’t identified a specific ADHD gene, lots of studies show a genetic link. It’s quite common for a 
            person diagnosed with ADHD to have at least one close relative with the condition. Environmental factors may also play 
            a role. These include exposure to pesticides and lead, a brain injury, being born prematurely or with a low birth weight. 
            <br><br>
            “The brain is essentially a huge electrical system that has multiple sub-systems that need to communicate with one 
            another constantly to get anything done,” explains Thomas Brown, Ph.D., director of the Brown Clinic for Attention 
            & Related Disorders in Hamden, CT.  Brown is considered a leading global authority on the assessment and treatment 
            of ADHD. In his book A New Understanding of ADHD in Children And Adults: Executive Function Impairments (Taylor and 
            Francis Group, LLC, 2013), he explains why someone with ADHD really struggles with things like listening and completing
            assignments in a timely manner: The brain communicates messages through neurons in the brain. But at the end of 
            every neuron there is a gap called a synapse. The message needs to jump between the gaps, and does this with the aid
            of a chemical called a neurotransmitter produced by the body. “Persons with ADHD tend not to release enough of these 
            essential chemicals, or to release and reload them too quickly before an adequate connection has been made.” In effect, 
            messages struggle to get where they need to go to be acted on. Medications, including stimulants and non-stimulants, 
            help make up for these deficits by triggering the release of certain chemicals, which in turn help the neurons to 
            communicate with each other.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">Symptoms of ADHD</p>
        <p class="content">
            A child or adult with ADHD will show varying degrees of these three behaviors:  inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity.
            <br><br>
            However, it’s important to mention that any child or adult—meaning even people without ADHD—will demonstrate one or 
            more of these associated behaviors at any given time. Most people with ADHD will experience a combination of symptoms 
            from each of the subtypes—inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. When signs of inattention, impulsivity and 
            hyperactivity are seen for at least 6 months and demonstrated in more than one setting, such as the home, classroom 
            or at work, ADHD may be the cause.
            <br><br>
            A diagnosis of ADHD in a child age 16 or younger should be considered when he or she presents with six or more 
            symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that are characterized as inappropriate for their 
            developmental level. Examples of these symptoms are outlined, below.
            <br><br>
            From age 17 and up, a clinician will look for 5 or more symptoms of inattention and/or impulsivity and hyperactivity 
            that are developmentally inappropriate.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">Symptoms of Inattention:</p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Frequent difficulty focusing on tasks, including homework or meeting work deadlines</li>
            <li>Often struggles to follow through on projects, assignments, and chores</li>
            <li>Has difficulty staying organized and misses deadlines</li>
            <li>Is often easily distracted</li>
            <li>Often fails to respond when being spoken to</li>
            <li>Has difficulty keeping track of important items such as keys, cell phone, homework assignment pad.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="head1">Symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity:</p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Lacks careful thought/does not consider the potential consequences before acting on something or expressing one’s feelings</li>
            <li>Abnormally active and/or disruptive behavior</li>
            <li>Talks excessively</li>
            <li>Struggles to be quiet during leisure activities</li>
            <li>Finds it difficult to wait his turn</li>
            <li>Squirms in his seat; fidgets with his hands and feet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Another way a doctor may evaluate and categorize symptoms is by grouping them into categories. Dr. Brown’s 
            research has pinpointed how the symptoms of cognitive function impairment caused by ADHD tend to show up in 
            six clusters. These include: activation, focus, effort, emotion, memory and action.
            <br><br>
            For instance, initiating and organizing tasks, fall under “activation” and difficulty completing tasks or sustaining 
            effort fall under “effort.” Under effort is also regulating alertness—a person with ADHD may not be able to quiet 
            their mind enough to fall asleep when they should.
            <br><br>
            Less often described in ADHD literature is the “emotion cluster.” Dr. Brown, who’s assessed and treated patients 
            with ADHD for more than 25 years, says they often report difficulty with managing emotions that include anger, 
            worry, frustration, and disappointment. These create additional challenges for the person with ADHD.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">Treating ADHD</p>
        <p class="content">There is no cure for ADHD. But the condition can be treated in children and adults with medication and 
        therapy. The National Institute of Mental Health says for the best outcome, a combination of medication and behavioral 
        therapy should be used.</p>
        <p class="head1">What types of medications are used for ADHD?</p>
        <p class="content">Two types of drugs are approved to treat ADHD: stimulants and non-stimulants.</p>
            <br><br>
            <ol class="content">
                <li style="font-weight: bold;">Stimulants : </li>
                <p class="content">Stimulant drugs are the most commonly used medications to treat ADHD.  Stimulants work by increasing 
                    brain chemicals, including dopamine, that are critical for transmitting messages between brain neurons. 
                    In kids, 70 to 80 percent show improvement in symptoms within one to two hours of taking the medication. 
                    In adults, 70 percent report noticeable improvement from stimulants within hours of using the medication.
                    <br><br>
                    The two generic stimulants, also known as central nervous system stimulants, that are widely used to treat ADHD 
                    are methylphenidate (Concerta, Aptensio XR) and dextro-amphetamine (Adderall). 
                </p>
                <li style="font-weight: bold;">Non-stimulants : </li>
                <p class="content">In cases where a stimulant drug is not well tolerated or  preferred, there is atomoexetine (Straterra), a 
                    non-stimulant that helps increase a brain chemical called norepinephrine. This chemical can help improve 
                    focus, while tamping down impulsiveness and hyperactivity. Clonidine (Kapvay) and Guanfacine (Intuniv) are 
                    also non-stimulants and work slightly differently to achieve similar effects.
                </p>
            </ol>
        <p class="head1">Therapy</p>
        <p class="content">
            Cognitive behavioral therapy and psychoeduation are recommended for people with ADHD to provide a framework for how to 
            better manage emotions and general behavior. Therapy can also focus on strategies to help with self- regulation and 
            self-monitoring. This education can help a child or adult with ADHD as they face day-to-day challenge’s at home, 
            in the classroom, at work, and in social situations. In addition, social skills groups can be beneficial for children 
            and teens with ADHD, who often struggle with their social interactions, due to impulsivity. Therapy usually occurs one 
            time per week, for 45 minutes at a time.
