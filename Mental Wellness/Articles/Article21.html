        What Is Depression?
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Being depressed often feels like carrying a very heavy burden, but you are not alone in this struggle.
            Millions of Americans suffer from some form of depression every year, making it one of the most common 
            mental disorders in the country. <br><br>

            Gaining a deeper understanding of depression can help begin the journey to recovery. Taking some time 
            to learn more about the causes and symptoms of depression will assist you greatly when it comes time to consider 
            methods of treatment. <br><br>

            Depression is more than just feeling sad. Everyone feels upset or unmotivated from time to time, but depression is more serious.
            It is a mood disorder characterized by prolonged feelings of sadness and loss of interest in daily activities. If these symptoms 
            persist for a period of at least two weeks, it is considered a depressive episode.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">
            Causes of Depression
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            There is no one cause for depression, as it depends on a unique combination of an individual’s genetic makeup and 
            environmental conditions. There are many factors to take into account: <br><br>
            <ul class="content">
                <li>The brain’s physical structure or chemistry</li>
                <li>History of depression in the family</li>
                <li>History of other disorders (anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder)</li>
                <li>Stressful, traumatic events (abuse, financial issues, death of a loved one)</li>
                <li>Hormone changes (menstrual cycles, pregnancy)</li>
                <li>Certain medications (sleeping aids, blood pressure medication)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="head1">
            Signs and Symptoms of Depression
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Though there are multiple types of depression, many of them have similar recognizable symptoms.
            This list scratches the surface, but it provides a general idea of what comprises depression: <br><br>
            <ul class="content">
                <li>Persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or emptiness</li>
                <li>Irritability, frustration, or restlessness</li>
                <li>Loss of interest in activities or hobbies that used to be enjoyable</li>
                <li>Difficulty sleeping, sleep disturbances or sleeping too much</li>
                <li>Fatigue and lack of energy</li>
                <li>Difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, concentrating, or making decisions</li>
                <li>Appetite or weight changes</li>
                <li>Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide</li>
                <li>Physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or back pain</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="content">Experiencing some combination of these symptoms for a period of at least two weeks likely 
            signifies that you are in the midst of a depressive episode. </p>
        </p>
        <p class="head1">
            Treatment
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Any treatment for depression should coincide with a healthy diet and a regular sleep schedule.
            It may sound simplistic, but the importance of taking care of your body cannot be overstated. <br><br>

            There are various methods you could use to sooth the symptoms of depression. All of us could stand to 
            exercise more often, but exercise is especially helpful for the depressed mind. It enables you to better 
            handle stress, and the endorphins released during exercise give you a mental boost. Aside from the mental 
            health benefits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that physical activity helps 
            you sleep better at night. <br><br>

            If you enjoy keeping a journal, you may find that it helps to express your thoughts on paper instead of 
            bottling them inside. It’s helpful to have close friends and family who you can confide in, but they’re 
            not always available or may be dealing with stress of their own. This makes keeping a journal a good idea 
            to have an alternate way to vent. <br><br>

            Therapy with anyone from a guidance counselor to a certified therapist can work wonders, and many may prefer 
            therapy over the medication route. Situational depression especially can be relieved by having a way to get 
            everything off your chest and receive practical advice. <br><br>

            For a more hands-on approach, try experts like psychiatrists or psychologists. They offer many types of therapy, 
            from light therapy for Seasonal Affective Disorder to cognitive behavioral therapy that works to change your 
            thought processes. <br><br>

            Other alternatives include drinking special teas or taking supplements. The properties of green tea and chamomile 
            tea give them a calming effect, and some have found success drinking St. John’s Wort tea to treat depression.
            It can also be taken as a supplement. While there is no proof that St. John’s Wort improves depression symptoms, 
            fish oil, and SAM-e are supplements with a proven impact. <br><br>

            There is no shame in taking medication to manage your depression. People routinely take medication for physical 
            ailments, and having a mental illness isn’t any different. If you’re worried about the possible side effects, 
            call your doctor to discuss them. Any medication can be tapered down or ceased, and there are different types 
            available to suit your individual needs and chemistry. <br><br>

            Remember that recovery is a journey, not a destination. Bad days will still come, but with well-targeted 
            treatment, you should be able to overcome extreme lows. While science has yet to find a cure for mental disorders 
            such as depression, it is entirely possible to live a happy and fulfilling life in spite of it. <br><br>
