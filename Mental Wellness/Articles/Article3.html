        <p class="head1">Symptoms</p>
        <p class="content">
            Individuals with paranoid personality disorder typically
            experience symptoms that interfere with daily life.2? In
            general, people with this condition feel suspicious of
            others. While this mistrust is unfounded, their distrust
            of others makes it difficult to form relationships and can
            interfere with many aspects of life including at home, at
            school, and at work. People with PPD do not see their behaviors
            as out of the ordinary but are perceived by others as hostile and suspicious. <br><br>

            The primary characteristic of this condition is a
            chronic and pervasive distrust and suspicion of
            others. Other symptoms of paranoid personality disorder include: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li> Feelings that they are being lied to, deceived, or exploited by other people </li>
            <li>May believe that friends, family, and romantic partners are untrustworthy and unfaithful</li>
            <li>Outbursts of anger in response to perceived deceptio</li>
            <li>Often described as cold, jealous, secretive, and serious</li>
            <li>Overly controlling in relationships in order to avoid being exploited or manipulated</li>
            <li>Look for hidden meanings in gestures and conversations</li>
            <li>Find it difficult to relax</li>
            <li>Often hold negative views of other people</li>
            <li>Overly sensitive to criticism</li>
            <li>Overreacts in response to perceived criticism</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
            Disorders (DSM5) specifies that in addition to
            having symptoms of pervasive suspicion and distrust,
            a diagnosis of PPD requires that these symptoms must not be
            related to a psychotic episode associated with schizophrenia,
            bipolar disorder, or depressive disorder with psychotic features. <br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="head1">Causes</p>
        <p class="content">While the exact causes of PDD are not known,
            it is believed that both genetics and psychological factors play
            a role. There is also likely a strong genetic component since a family
            history of schizophrenia is considered a risk factor for paranoid personality
            disorder. Childhood experiences and trauma may also play a part in the development
            of the condition.1? </p>

        <p class="head1">Treatment</p>
        <p class="content" >Paranoid personality disorder is 
            generally treated with psychotherapy. 
            With ongoing treatment and appropriate support, 
            people with this condition can manage their symptoms and 
            function more effectively in daily life <br><br>

            However, people who have PPD may not seek treatment
             for their condition, usually because they do not feel
              that they have a problem. To those with PPD, their 
              suspicions of others are justified and it is other
               people who are the problem. The distrust and paranoia
                that characterizes the condition also make it difficult
                 for people with PPD to trust their doctors and therapists.3?
                  This can make it challenging for healthcare professionals to
                   establish a therapeutic rapport with the individual.
        
        </p>


        <p class="head1">Psychotherapy</p>
        <p class="content" >Treatments for PPD usually focus on 
            helping people develop coping skills. Therapy often
             focuses on building empathy, trust, communication, 
             self-esteem, social relationships, communication skills,
              and general coping abilities. <br><br>
            
              Treatments for PPD usually focus on helping people
               develop coping skills. Therapy often focuses on building 
               empathy, trust, communication, self-esteem, social relationships,
                communication skills, and general coping abilities. <br><br> 

                Ingrained paranoid beliefs and maladaptive thoughts play a 
                role in maintaining paranoid personality disorder, which is why 
                addressing these thoughts and beliefs through CBT can be helpful.4? 
                CBT may help people with PPD become better able to trust others. By 
                challenging maladaptive thoughts and working to change harmful behaviors,
                 people with this condition may become less suspicious of others, including 
                 friends and family, which can improve relationships and social interactions.  <br><br>

                 In addition to addressing harmful thoughts and beliefs,
                  CBT also works to help people with PPD better manage their 
                  responses to others. Rather than responding to comments with
                   anger or hostility, for example, people can learn more appropriate
                    ways of dealing with their emotions. 
            </p>

        <p class="head1">Medication</p>
        <p class="content" >While medication is not usually used to treat
             paranoid personality disorder, but may be used in cases where 
             symptoms are severe or if an associated condition such as depression
              or anxiety is also present. Prescribed drugs included antidepressants,
               antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety medications. 2? Medications alone are not
                a recommended treatment for personality disorders and are best used in combination
                 with psychotherapy.</p>

        <p class="head1">A Word From Verywell</p>
        <p class="content" >While paranoid personality disorder is 
            one of the more common personality disorders, there is a 
            lack of research on effective treatments, due in part to
             the reluctance of those with the condition to participate 
             in treatment and research.1? Those who are able to develop a
              successful therapeutic relationship can learn to manage their
               symptoms and have more successful relationships with others.</p>
