        <h1>Paranoid Personality Disorder</h1>
        <p class="content">
            People with paranoid personality disorder have a deep and unwarranted mistrust of others, which tends to
            have a significant effect on their relationships with family, friends, and co-workers.
            <br><br>
            Paranoid personality disorder (PPD)is among the most common personality disorders. Experts believe that this
            disorder may affect up to 4.41% of the population.
            <br><br>
            People with PPD feel threatened by others, so they are usually reluctant to seek medical attention. As a
            result, many clinicians have little experience in diagnosing and treating the disorder. There are also no
            clinical studies or treatment guidelines available.
            <br><br>
            In this article, we outline the current understanding of PPD. We explore the causes and symptoms of the
            disorder, as well as the treatment options available.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">What is it?</p>
        <p class="content">
            People with PPD have suspicious, unforgiving, and jealous personality traits. Some doctors also believe that
            people with PPD have traits of excessive self-importance and hostility.
            <br><br>
            PPD can occur as a standalone disorder. However, people with the following conditions may also show symptoms
            of PPD:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>schizophrenia</li>
            <li>schizoaffective and psychotic states of bipolar disorder</li>
            <li>Alzheimer’s disease</li>
            <li>brain injury</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Experts know little else about PPD. One reason for this is that people with PPD tend to be reluctant to
            volunteer for clinical studies.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">Symptoms</p>
        <p class="content">
            People with PPD are distrusting or suspicious of others. They tend to see other people as a threat and
            generally feel as though others will harm or deceive them. This disorder prevents people from confiding in
            others and having close, meaningful relationships.
            <br><br>
            Some additional signs and symptoms of PPD include :
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>sensitivity to criticism</li>
            <li>increased alertness</li>
            <li>aggressiveness</li>
            <li>emotional rigidity</li>
            <li>an excessive need to be or work alone</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Substance misuse problems are also common among people with PPD.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">Diagnosis</p>
        <p class="content">
            A doctor will assess a person to see whether they satisfy the criteria for PPD that the DSM-5 outlines.
            <br><br>
            The DSM-5 describes PPD as a deep distrust and suspicion of others. According to the DSM-5, people with such
            feelings will interpret others’ motives as malicious and spiteful.
            <br><br>
            Healthcare professionals will only diagnose a person with PPD if they fulfill at least four of the following
            criteria:
        </p>
        <ol class="content">
            <li>Suspecting that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them.</li>
            <li>Worrying about loyalty and whether they can trust their family, friends, or co-workers.</li>
            <li>Avoiding confiding in others because of a fear that people will use any information against them.</li>
            <li>Interpreting remarks or events as demeaning or threatening without justification.</li>
            <li>Holding grudges.</li>
            <li>Perceiving attacks on their character and reputation that are unapparent to others and acting
                aggressively in response.</li>
            <li>Suspecting that a spouse or partner is unfaithful without justification.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="content">
            Some of the diagnostic criteria overlap with those of other conditions, such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>bipolar disorder</li>
            <li>schizophrenia</li>
            <li>a depressive disorder with psychotic features</li>
            <li>other psychotic disorders</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Due to this overlap, a healthcare professional will only diagnose PPD if the symptoms are not wholly
            attributable to one of the above conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">Causes</p>
        <p class="content">
            Most studies investigating the causes of different psychological disorders tend to group all of the
            personality disorders. For this reason, it is difficult to identify the causes of one particular personality
            disorder, such as PPD.
            <br><br>
            However, according to a 2017 review, studies have consistently shown childhood trauma to be a risk factor
            for PPD.
            <br><br>
            Researchers have also identified other factors that may predict PPD symptoms in adolescence and adulthood.
            These include:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>emotional neglect</li>
            <li>physical neglect</li>
            <li>supervisory neglect</li>
            <li>extreme or unfounded parental rage</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Further research is necessary to explore the causes and risk factors of PPD.

        <p class="content">
            Researchers have only recently begun to study PPD, so doctors know little about treating the condition.
            <br><br>
            No clinical trials are available for PPD because it is not currently a high priority for clinicians, and
            there is a lack of volunteer participants.
            <br><br>
            However, doctors may sometimes consider the following treatment options for people with PPD.
