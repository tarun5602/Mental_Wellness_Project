        <h1>A guide to OCD signs, symptoms, causes, and treatment</h1><br>
        <p class="head1">Signs and Symptoms of OCD</p>
        <p class="content">
            We’ve talked a lot about hand washing rituals. But this is only touching the tip of the iceberg when it
            comes to OCD. What exactly are obsessions and compulsions? What other types of behaviors represent this
            disorder? What are the signs of OCD? Read on to find out.
            <br><br>
            Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety in an individual.
            Some of the more common themes of obsessions include:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Fear of germs</li>
            <li>The need to have things in perfect, symmetrical order</li>
            <li>Taboo thoughts or other unwanted thoughts are things such as sex, religion, or harm</li>
            <li>Aggressive thoughts toward yourself or toward others</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">Some of the more common obsession signs and symptoms include:</p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Fear of being contaminated with germs or dirt by shaking hands with another person or touching objects
                that are not yours</li>
            <li>Feeling intensely stressed out when certain belonging are not facing in the same direction (need for
                order and symmetry)</li>
            <li>Avoiding situations that could cause obsessive thoughts (e.g., avoiding shaking another person’s hand
                for fear of getting germs or dirt on your own hands)</li>
            <li>Constant doubt that you locked the door to your house/car and/or turned your stove off</li>
            <li>Thoughts about horrifically hurting yourself or hurting others</li>
            <li>Obsessive thoughts about shouting inappropriate things or obscenities</li>
            <li>Feeling stressed out when you replay unwanted sexual images in your head repeatedly</li>
            <li>Fear of being embarrassed</li>
            <li>Excessive doubt and need for reassurance</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Compulsions are the direct result of obsessions. When you suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder, your
            obsessive thoughts lead to repetitive behaviors (compulsions) you feel are necessary to perform. You perform
            these behaviors to reduce the anxiety produced from obsessive thoughts and to prevent something bad from
            happening. If you are coping with obsessive-compulsive disorder, you likely know that these compulsions only
            provide temporary relief and bring no pleasure.
            <br><br>
            Common themes surrounding compulsions include:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Counting</li>
            <li>Checking</li>
            <li>Washing/cleaning</li>
            <li>Maintaining strict routines</li>
            <li>Need for reassurance</li>
            <li>Orderliness</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">Common compulsion signs and symptoms include:</p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Excessive hand washing, often causing your hands to become raw and sometimes bleed</li>
            <li>Patterned counting behaviors</li>
            <li>Repeated checking that the stove is turned off</li>
            <li>Repeated checking of door locks</li>
            <li>Refusing to shake hands or touch door knobs</li>
            <li>Eating foods in a specific order and/or not allowing foods to touch</li>
            <li>Collecting or hoarding items</li>
            <li>Repeating a prayer or phrase to yourself</li>
            <li>Ordering and arranging things in a precise, symmetrical way</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            If you are suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder, your symptoms may come and go over time and also
            vary in intensity.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">How Is OCD Diagnosed and What Causes It?</p>
        <p class="content">
            What causes obsessive-compulsive disorder? Doctors and mental health professionals cannot pinpoint an exact
            cause but believe both genetics and environmental factors play a role in the occurrence of OCD. Twin and
            family studies reveal a higher likelihood of developing OCD if first-degree relatives also suffer from the
            disorder. Research has shown that the likelihood also increases if the first-degree relative developed OCD
            at an early age.
            <br><br>
            Individuals suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder also have varying brain structures from those of a
            population without OCD. Studies indicate abnormalities in the frontal cortex and subcortical structures of
            the brain in OCD patients; however, more extensive research is needed to more definitively understand this
            biological occurrence.
            <br><br>
            Environmental factors that are thought to increase your chances of developing OCD include experiencing
            physical or sexual abuse during childhood or other types of trauma.
            <br><br>
            When obsessions and compulsions are negatively affecting your everyday life, it is wise to see a doctor or
            mental health professional. Adults who are suffering from OCD are likely aware of their thoughts and
            behaviors; however, children are usually unaware that something’s amiss. Oftentimes, parents or teachers are
            the ones who first notice OCD symptoms occurring in youth or adolescents. Its negative impact can affect
            your social, interpersonal, work, and school life, interrupting daily routines by spending excessive amounts
            of time on obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions.
            <br><br>
            Your mental health provider will perform a mental health assessment to confirm an OCD diagnosis and your
            physician will perform an exam and blood work to rule out other underlying causes. A number of comprehensive
            obsessive-compulsive disorder screenings exist to determine the occurrence of OCD and the severity of it.
            Once diagnosed, you and your mental health provider will work together to determine the best treatment
            options and coping mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p class="head1">OCD Treatment</p>
        <p class="content">
            The most common treatment options for obsessive-compulsive disorder are medication and psychotherapy, or a
            combination of both.
            <br><br>
            If you are suffering from OCD, you may be prescribed serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) or selective
            serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to control symptoms. Antidepressants are normally tried first to
            control OCD symptoms. The most commonly prescribed medications include:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Sertraline (Zoloft)</li>
            <li>Fluoxetine (Prozac)</li>
            <li>Clomipramine (Anafranil)</li>
            <li>Fluvoxamine (Luvox, CR)</li>
            <li>Paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            In some cases, antipsychotics are prescribed to treat OCD, or a combination of antidepressants and
            antipsychotics. If you have been prescribed a medication for treatment of OCD, it is important to note that
            many of these medications may take a number of weeks or months to have a full effect on your symptoms.
            <br><br>
            Your doctor might also suggest psychotherapy as a treatment option for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
            Psychotherapy is meant to change your negative thought patterns to related to obsessions and resultant
            compulsions. With OCD, exposure and response prevention (ERP) has been found to be the most effective
            treatment option. A form of cognitive behavioral therapy, this method of exposure therapy gradually exposes
            you to your obsession (e.g., dirt) to allow you to cope with your anxiety in a healthier way. Many times,
            doctors will prescribe ERP therapy in conjunction with medications when SRIs and SSRIs are not effective
            enough on their own. Individual, family, and group sessions of exposure therapy are available.
            <br><br>
            Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic condition, meaning if you are suffering from this disorder, you
            may cope with it for your entire life. However, as our understanding of this condition grows, our treatment
            options and success rates of treatment evolve. Educate yourself about your condition, follow your doctor’s
            advice, and learn the warning signs and symptoms. Doing so keeps you proactive and informed of your disorder
            and enables you to live a healthy and productive life.
