        <p class="head1"> Deciding whether to tell your employer about
            your mental health can be difficult.
            Here’s a guide to advocating for yourself in the workplace <br><br></p>

        <h1> Why is it hard to talk to our bosses about mental health? </h1><br>
        <p class="content"> The conversation about our mental health at work is getting louder.
            You may have heard about the tweet that went viral last year when one
            CEO responded in the best way imaginable to the news that one of his
            employees was taking a couple of days to look after her mental health <br><br>

            Madalyn Parker, a Michigan-based web developer living with depression and anxiety,
            shared the email exchange with her boss on Twitter, where it has now been retweeted over
            15,000 times. In the exchange, her boss, Ben Congleton, thanks Parker for honesty and
            praises her as an “example to us all.” <br><br><br><br>

            But many of us still don’t feel comfortable talking to our bosses about our mental health.
            The harsh reality is that not every boss in America (or the rest of the world for that matter)
            is likely to respond as positively as Parker’s boss did when she opened up about her need for
            a mental health day off. <br><br>

            Work is a massive part of our lives; we work an average of 38.6 hours
            per week and, when you factor in time spent
            commuting that’s even more of our lives we dedicate to work—even when
            we’re not working. And, no matter how much
            you love your job, we all have bad days at work. The truth is, none
            of us is immune from experiencing mental ill
            health, just as none of us is immune from physical illness. <br><br>

            I’m sure all of us have experienced periods of huge stress at work.
            Perhaps you recognize these symptoms: exhaustion, brain fog, even burnout.
            These feelings have a huge impact on our general sense of well-being,
            not only when we’re in the office, but after we leave, too. Sometimes, they
            can be relieved by a day off (whether that’s calling in sick or taking a mental health day) or
            by taking a period of annual leave.


        </p>
        <h1>
            Do you have to disclose your mental health to your boss?
        </h1>
        <p class="content">
            Well, frankly, no. If there’s no work-related reason for you to disclose it,
            then you don’t have to open up about any mental challenges you are facing.
            If, however, your state of mind is affecting your ability to complete your work,
            your attitude towards it, your relationship with your coworkers or any other issue
            related to your work environment, then a conversation may be necessary. <br><br>

            According to Tanisha Ranger, PsyD, a psychologist who has helped many
            patients decide whether or not to bring up their mental health issues with their
            boss, the right decision really “depends” on the particular situation. <br><br>

            “If you know your boss well and have a good working relationship,
            I think it could really be beneficial to tell him/her about your mental illness,
            ” says the Nevada-based therapist. “Understanding what you struggle with and how
            it can impact your work, can give you and your boss the opportunity to tailor your
            environment to optimize your chances for success. It can also reduce the stress you
            might experience at work (especially that which is a result of having to hold onto that
            secret). That kind of support can decrease the likelihood of experiencing negative symptoms
            that could negatively impact you, your work environment, your co-workers, and the business
            overall.” <br><br>

            However, if you do not know your boss well or do not have a good working relationship,
            telling him/her about your mental health concerns could be detrimental. “It is extremely
            important that you know who you work for, and what the laws are, concerning mental illness
            in the workplace,” Dr. Ranger stresses. “In some instances, it may be in your best interest
            to just make sure to have the appropriate Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) paperwork on file
            with the HR (human resources) department (who are legally required to protect your private health
            information) so that you can be absent from work when you absolutely need to be. There may be ways
            to tailor your environment that do not require you to disclose your diagnoses.” <br> <br>

            When it comes to talking about your mental health, it’s vital that you advocate for yourself,
            which is where the laws come in. Those who work for companies with 15 or more employees are covered
            under the American Disabilities Act and the company is required by law to provide reasonable accommodations
            if you ask. Additionally, some companies offer mental health services, such as an Employee Assistance
            Program (EAP) where you can receive a limited number of free mental health counseling sessions. <br><br>

            And, it really is in your employer’s interest to listen and help you; mental illness costs employers an
            estimated $225.8 billion each year. One of the obvious causes is due to absenteeism, or regularly missing
            work. But, causes that can often be overlooked include the decreased performance that occurs when we work
            while sick, as well as presenteeism. <br><br>

            What is important to recognize though, is that ongoing mental health conditions—be it depression, anxiety,
            or anything else—cannot be so easily resolved by taking the odd day off. It takes ongoing support, through
            the ups and downs. If your boss doesn’t know what you’re going through, he/she won’t be able to provide you
            with the support or provisions that you need. <br><br>

            What it all boils down to is knowing that at your boss wants you to perform to the best of your ability when
            you’re at work; whatever industry you’re in, whatever skill or trade you have, it makes no difference.
            <br><br>

        <h1> Why it’s important <br><br></h1>
        <p class="content">Being upfront about your mental health helps to create an honest and open environment around
            you. Disclosing your struggles can actually be a great form of relief, too. In many cases, once you open up
            about your mental health issues you may no longer feel like you’re dealing with this alone and provisions
            can be put in place to help you reach a better state of mind. As awkward as it might feel to have the
            conversation, things can only improve. It’s illegal to be discriminated against because of your mental
            health, and the law also allows for you to be appropriately accommodated. You won’t be penalized for opening
            up. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h1>
            How to do it <br>
        </h1>
        <p class="content"> So, we know why it’s important to talk about our mental health at work. Now we’ll look at
            the steps you can take
            to do this. <br></p>

        <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;">Note: All workplaces are different. Some people may work
            directly with their line-manager or boss, whereas
            others may not come into contact with them for weeks or months at a time. When we use the term ‘boss’, think
            who
            this might translate to in your own work environment </p> <br><br>

        <h3>1. Consult others (if you can) </h3>
        <p class="content"> In the case of bullying or harassment, try speaking to a member of HR. There are often
            procedures in place that
            will support you. It might also be best to approach HR if you’re not confident enough to have the discussion
            with your boss or are worried about the way he/she will react.

            Or, depending on your situation, you may benefit from speaking to a colleague. Having a work friend/buddy
            can be
            helpful—a person you can regularly check-in with that understands your workload and what the work
            environment is
            like. Mention to your work buddy that you are thinking of talking to your boss. Having someone to support
            you
            through the process can make it seem less daunting.</p><br>

        <h3>2. Think about what you need </h3>
        <p class="content"> Think about why you’re disclosing this information in the first place—what support do you
            need? Hold off on
            telling your boss until you are clear about what you’re hoping to gain by sharing this information. If you
            are
            telling your boss because you want to have fewer responsibilities or longer deadlines, for example, consider
            researching your organization’s HR policies first.

            Maybe you need a little flexibility with deadlines, some time off, or to cut your hours down slightly. Or,
            you
            might need to consider whether flexible hours or remote working might be a better long-term solution. Or,
            maybe
            you need to see a therapist.

            It’s also OK if you’re not sure about what to do or what help you need—no one is expecting you to be an
            expert,
            especially if this is the first time you’ve experienced a mental health problem. Try to think of small
            changes
            that can be easily made.

            Once you are clear about the changes you need, go to HR first and carefully document the meeting, advises
            attorney Matt C. Pinker, who often advises clients on workplace issues. “Other times, HR can help you put
            together a plan of action which you can then take to your boss,” he advises. “You do not want to be in a
            position where the boss could unilaterally decide to terminate you after this disclosure, and HR may be able
            to
            prevent that.”</p><br>

        <h3>3. Find the right time(and place) </h3>
        <p class="content"> We can’t know for certain what our mental health will be like in the future but, if you can,
            try to predict a
            suitable day/time to bring up the topic. Approaching your boss on a day with things are calm in the office
            is
            best.

            Try to meet in a place where you’ll be able to talk in a calm and collected way. If there isn’t a quiet
            space
            within your workplace, suggest going somewhere else, or even for a walk. Walking can take the corporate
            feeling
            out of the meeting and being outside might bring a new perspective to how you’re </p><br>

        <h3>4. When the time is right, go for it </h3>
        <p class="content">The relationship you have with your boss will determine the best way for you both to have the
            discussion. It
            might be easier for you to request a one-to-one by email, as this can allow you to book some private time
            away
            from your colleagues.

            But, if your workplace (or your relationship with your boss) is less formal, and you are able to just go for
            a
            coffee and a chat, that’s fine and may be best. Talking about your mental health doesn’t need to be scary or
            over-complicated, you can start the conversation by simply saying, “I need to get something off my chest” or
            “I
            need to talk, do you have time to listen?” Just remember to tell your boss only what is necessary. Be clear
            and
            concise, stating the specifics of how your mental health problems are impacting your work. The point here is
            to
            keep it professional and appropriate—your boss is not a therapist or close friend, so you need to stick to
            what
            matter’s to the workplace </p><br>

        <h3>5. Take care of yourself </h3>
        <p class="content"> By having a conversation with your boss and keeping him/her in the loop about your mental
            health, you can start
            to make the changes that will benefit you. If you’re concerned about how your boss might respond to your
            disclosure, consider asking a friend or your therapist to role-play the conversation you anticipate having
            with
            him. That way, you’ll feel much more prepared and relaxed when the time comes. Make sure you’re taking
            proper
            care of yourself outside of work too—self-care, exercise and a balanced diet—as this can have a big impact
            on
            your overall sense of well-being. </p>

        <p>
        <h3> While it can seem easier said than done, you really shouldn’t be ashamed of your mental health issues or
            let
            them prevent you from being happy and healthy in your career.</h3>
